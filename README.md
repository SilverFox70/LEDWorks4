# LEDWorks4
Program developed for Blue Man Group to aid in programming Sunnywell LED signs. 
Includes a simple GUI form to input names for fields, which, when submitted generates
the text that will be sent to the sign.  A third party plug-in allows for serial
communication via RS232 to the sign.  

A config file allows the program to use different source files and settings to handle
the unique needs of each show.  There is also a console that can be started to monitor
input, output, and function calls.  It was primarily used as a debugging tool.
