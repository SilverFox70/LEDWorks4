@SOF        @PA9@PA8        THAT'S A POLITE WAY OF SAYING   "GO PEE NOW." @PA2               @PA4            DON'T LISTEN TO THE SIGN ON THE RIGHT. HE'S GOT CONTROL ISSUES. BUT KEEP IT ON THE DOWNLOW. AND NO FLASHES PLEASE. (IT REALLY IS DISRUPTIVE).                @PA1     WOW, THIS IS A LOT TO REMEMBER                 @PA3    I THINK HE JUST MEANS TAKING "BAD QUALITY" VIDEO FOOTAGE IS LAME.    WHAT IS UP WITH ALL OF THE "SHAKY HANDS" ON YOUTUBE VIDEOS?                        ANOTHER THING TO NOTE?     IS SOMEONE JOTTING ALL THIS DOWN?                  @PA3          BECAUSE IT MAKES THE OLDER PEOPLE FEEL INADEQUATE.    TWEETING HOWEVER, IS OK.                @PA4         THEY'RE TOO BUSY TEXTING.    MAYBE IF WE JOIN FORCES WE CAN GET THEM TO FOCUS.                           %@SOFYOUR ATTENTION PLEASE.
