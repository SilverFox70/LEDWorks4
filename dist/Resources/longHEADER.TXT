@SOF                @PA9@PA9          THAT'S A POLITE WAY OF SAYING   "GO PEE NOW." @PA2                        @PA6 DON'T LISTEN TO THE SIGN ON THE RIGHT. HE'S GOT CONTROL ISSUES. BUT KEEP IT ON THE DOWNLOW. AND NO FLASHES PLEASE. (IT REALLY IS DISRUPTIVE).                @PA1     WOW, THIS IS A LOT TO REMEMBER                 @PA3 @PA1     I THINK HE JUST MEANS TAKING "BAD QUALITY" VIDEO FOOTAGE IS LAME.    WHAT IS UP WITH ALL OF THE "SHAKY HANDS" ON YOUTUBE VIDEOS?                 @PA1 ANOTHER THING TO NOTE?     IS SOMEONE JOTTING ALL THIS DOWN?                  @PA4   BECAUSE IT MAKES THE OLDER PEOPLE FEEL INADEQUATE.    TWEETING HOWEVER, IS OK.                @PA6  THEY'RE TOO BUSY TEXTING.    MAYBE IF WE JOIN FORCES WE CAN GET THEM TO FOCUS.                  @PA1                   %@SOFYOUR ATTENTION PLEASE.        YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE.
